# Hi there, I'm Kevin Lin <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I'm a Business enthusiast who loves diving into data and finding insights that drive strategy and innovation. But there's more to me than just numbers and models — I enjoy a vibrant mix of sports, life with my adorable golden retriever, and dreaming big about future entrepreneurial ventures.

## Beyond the screen

When I'm not immersed in data or brainstorming strategies, I love to stay active and explore life beyond the screen:

- ⚽ **Sports Fanatic:** Whether it's soccer, tennis, golf, or badminton, I’m always up for a game.
- 🐾 **Proud Pet Parent:** I share my life with a cute golden retriever who never fails to brighten my day.
- 🤔 **Inquisitive Explorer:** I’m always fascinated by how things work and love unraveling the logic behind everyday puzzles.
- 🏔️ **Aspiring Innovator:** Driven to create meaningful solutions that make a positive impact, even as I shape my future venture.

## Recent Projects

Here are a few projects I've been working on recently:

- ♻️ **RealWaste Classification**  
  This project develops an automated waste sorting system using deep learning to improve recycling efficiency. It employs a custom CNN and a hybrid ResNet50-KNN model to classify waste into nine categories: cardboard, food organics, glass, metal, plastic, etc.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pengrulin/RealWaste-Classification)
  
- 📰 **CNN Articles Sentiment Analysis**  
  This project uses NLP to analyze CNN articles (2011–2022) for sentiment and tone, aiming to understand messaging and potential biases. It applies text preprocessing techniques, the NLTK sentiment analyzer, market basket analysis, and timeline visualizations to identify sentiment patterns across sections and over time.

- 🚖 **NYC Taxi Price Estimation**  
  This project utilizes predictive analytics to optimize NYC taxi services by analyzing TLC Trip Record Data. Through data exploration, feature engineering, and model development, it identifies fare pricing patterns and inefficiencies. The goal is to improve pricing fairness and operational efficiency for both customers and taxi companies.
