# Hi there, I'm Kevin Lin 👋
I'm a Business enthusiast who loves diving into data and finding insights that drive strategy and innovation. But there's more to me than just numbers and models — I enjoy a vibrant mix of sports, life with my adorable golden retriever, and dreaming big about future entrepreneurial ventures.

## Beyond the screen

When I'm not immersed in data or brainstorming strategies, I love to stay active and explore life beyond the screen:

- ⚽ **Sports Fanatic:** Whether it's soccer, tennis, golf, or badminton, I’m always up for a game.
- 🐾 **Proud Pet Parent:** I share my life with a cute golden retriever who never fails to brighten my day.
- 🚀 **Future Entrepreneur:** I’m on a journey to discover and launch my venture — still figuring out what it will be, but the dream is alive!
